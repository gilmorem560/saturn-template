/*
 * an actor is a type object
 * an actor has:
 *  type - the type of actor, this is a property used by modes
 * 			actor itself does not define any types other than null
 *  collision_data - collision info structure
 *  properties - properties of the object itself, implementation defined
 *  render - render function, performs based on other properties
 * 	geometry arrays - arrays of data used for rendering
 * 	routine - function that routes object routines
 * 		three routine values are defined
 * 		-1 - null
 * 		0 - init
 * 		1 - free
 * 		all others are implementation defined
 *  routine_index - the routine value being run currently
 * 
 *  implementation:
 * 		enumerate/define mode's actor types
 * 		create actor related functionality
 * 			ensure defined routines above are provided
 * 		provide an actor routing method that calls routines
 * 			using switch on routine values
 * 		provide a rendering method that render's the actor model
 * 		routine methods will act on properties and collision data
